                        This is a special page of this app. This page will be populated with data only once a week.
                        Insights mean deeper meaning of something. With this page, I have tried to accomplished a system that will
                        analyze how you are creating and completing your tasks and then process them and show you a beautiful representation of
                        that data on this page.
                        <br><br>
                        So basically if you are a new user, this page will take about 7 days to learn about you and to collect enough data.
                        Since a week begins on a Monday, this page will be updated every Monday. After visiting this page on a Monday, the
                        contents of this page will not change until the next Monday, but during this period the system will again collect
                        data about your behavior and process it so that it can present them to you next Monday.
                        <br><br>
                        <p><b>So what is it really that you will be seeing here?</b></p>
                        Every user will be provided with <a style="color: cornflowerblue">three</a> sorts of insights for now.
                        <br>
                        Well, any user, regardless of if they have created any tasks this week or not, will be provided with a basic
                        insight that is that they will be able to see how many tasks they have created and completed since the day they joined
                        the app
                        <br>
                        Secondly, if the person was productive and created and completed many tasks since the last Monday, then they will also see
                        how many tasks they have created and how many they have actually completed among those.
                        <br>
                        Also, if some of the tasks that you created this week had any due dates, and you completed those tasks within
                        the due date (congrats btw) then you will also see how many tasks you have completed this week ON TIME!
                        <br><br>
                        <b>But what if I created my account on a day that was not a Monday?</b>
                        <br>
                        Well this can happen. If a user created their account on a Monday, then it's just miraculously perfect, they
                        will manage their tasks all week and the system will take 7 days to process data and their Insights Page will
                        be available next Monday. But if someone created their account on a day that was not a Monday, then a special request
                        will be made and the Insights will be generated instantly after 7 days from the creation date though with LESS data.
                        What I mean is, if someone created their account on a Wednesday, then on the next Wednesday they will see Insights about
                        their behavior till the previous Monday. Let's say 13th is a Wednesday and someone created their account and 20th is the next Wednesday. So on 20th, the user
                        will see data that they created FROM 11th (a Monday, yes your todos for those two days will be zero) UPTO 18th
                        which is a Monday. So actually the tasks created since 13th UPTO 18th will be analyzed and generated on 20th.
                        Keep in mind 20th is not a Monday but still the data is being generated, that's why this is a special request.
                        So 20th is a Wednesday, what now? Now, on the next Monday which is 25th, the user will get new generated data as usual. This time
                        they will see data FROM 18th UPTO 25th. Hope you get the idea. If you don't, dont fuss about it. Keep doing what you are doing
                        and visit this page every Monday if possible and you shall see some interesting numbers.
                        <br>
                        This is the last feature that I will be developing for this app. Thanks everyone who uses the app.
